## Hooks

### Desktop Notifications (macOS)
Get native macOS notifications when Claude needs your input or completes tasks.

**Prerequisites:**
```bash
brew install terminal-notifier
```

**Included notifications:**
- ðŸ”” When Claude needs your input
- âœ… When a task is completed

Notifications are automatically enabled when you install the plugin (if `terminal-notifier` is available).

## Installation

```bash
/plugin add https://github.com/matsengrp/plugins
```

### Local Development
```bash
cd /Users/matsen/re/plugins
/plugin add .
```

## Usage

### Agents
These agents will be available as specialized subagents that Claude Code can invoke automatically based on your task context, or you can invoke them manually using the Task tool.

### Slash Commands
Use slash commands directly in your conversation:
- `/pre-pr-check` - Run comprehensive pre-PR quality checklist
